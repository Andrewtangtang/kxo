# simrupt: A device that simulates interrupts

`simrupt` is a simple Linux kernel module to explain the concept of deferred
work and kernel concepts as following:
  - circular buffer
  - mutex lock
  - irq
  - softirq
  - tasklet
  - workqueue
  - kernel thread

It can be also used as a template to implement an IRQ-based device driver.
